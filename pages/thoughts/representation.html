    <p class='paragraph'>In recent weeks, there has been a number controversies surrounding representation in modern media, mainly in film. The three examples that come to mind are the Netflix adaptation of Death Note, Hollywood adaptation of Ghost in the Shell, and Disney’s live action adaptation of Beauty and the Beast. Death Note was originally a Japanese manga, and the casting of non-Asian actors in the lead roles has led to accusations of whitewashing [2]. Whitewashing is the practice of casting white actors in traditionally non-white roles, and has been present since the inception of the film industry. Similar claims arose with the casting of Scarlett Johansson for the lead role of Ghost in the Shell, a live action adaptation of a 1995 animated film, set in futuristic japan. The social outrage over the casting was furthered when reports came out that early screen tests used visual effects to make white actors look more Asian, instead of hiring Asian American actors [1]. In a sort of role reversal from these two examples, the production of Disney’s Beauty and the Beast aimed for representation through the inclusion of a gay side character [3]. This inclusion led to international controversy, with film boards in a number of countries (Malaysia, Russia, etc.) threatening to ban the film.</p>
    <p class='paragraph'>The combination of these controversies, as well as the in class discussions of how fan culture is linked to struggles for social change, led to self-reflection in my own media-consumption and fan participation. The vast majority of my constructed media consumption (non-social media such as movies, books, articles.) is in the form of movies, YouTube videos, and video games. Of the three, the latter is most interesting in the context of representation. These controversies, in the context of games, bring up the recurring issues of a lack of representation in the video games, while the focus on fan projects leads to a logical subsequent focus on indie games. Games are in an age of growing representation, and the driving forces behind this growth are the effects of diverse community dedication, and the prevalence of indie games as a form of personal expression. Both of these factors work in breaking up the homogeneity of historical gaming culture. This is best seen by looking at some current trends in video games, and one of the most recent indie releases.</p>

    <p class='paragraph'>Looking first at indie games, an indie game is an independent video game developed without the financial backing of an established publisher. While there are many relationships that can be drawn between indie games and fan projects, the most direct is that many games are fan projects, derived in some way from an original game. This derivation can range from a simple modification (mod) of the game that changes small elements of the whole, to full recreations or redesigns. The will often rebuild the original game from the ground up with either minimal or massive changes, based on the desires of the fan or fans. In addition to being fan projects, indie games often have a comparable lack of budget, resulting in many indie games being projects of passion or personal expression. This diversity of passion in itself creates greater representation, but to understand how indie games, and modern games in general, relate to social justice and representation, it is necessary to understand the historical lack of representation in games.</p>
    
    <p class='paragraph'>Gaming culture has a well-documented history of racism, sexism, and homophobia among its communities. This can be seen in the use of sexualized advertisement, such as “booth babes” at conventions, and in studies of the frequency of harassment based on the perceived sex, race, and sexual orientation [11] [12]. In addition to the problems of gaming culture, the actual representation within games is similarly biased. Women in video games are often sexually objectified, tied to tropes such as the “damsel-in-distress,” or bound to what are considered traditional gender roles. Similarly, many races and ethnic groups are rarely represented, or almost exclusively represented in a negative light. Examples of this include the statistics that “fewer than 3 percent of video game characters were recognizably Hispanic” and that African Americans were represented by 10.74 percent of characters, with the stipulation that “they were mostly athletes and gangsters” [13]. These biases also extend into gender and sexuality, where LGBTQ characters are mostly represented through tropes of “comical gender confusion,” or other stereotypes. There are of course historical exceptions to these trends, such as the early Mass Effect series and other BioWare games, which featured characters with a wide range of races, sexes, gender identities, and sexualities. Despite these exceptions, the overall history and state of representation in games still carries heavy bias.</p>

    <p class='paragraph'>Understanding this context better allows for understanding the impact of the modern titles like Overwatch, League of Legends, and Night in the Woods. Overwatch is a team-based first person shooter released in May 2016 by Blizzard Entertainment. Blizzard as a company is far from indie, having been founded in 1991 and having dominant games in a variety of genres. Blizzard has a dedicated fan base of players, so much so that when they release a new game, playtime across other games, even games of different genres, drops dramatically [14]. Much of this dedicated fan base is due to the company’s value of fans/customers. As both publisher and developer, the company is a unified face when interacting with fans. This makes fans much more familiar with the company, while also enabling stronger reactions to feedback. A Blizzard designer has stated that when designing their games, Blizzard focuses on catering to a “multiplicity of minority” [15] by designing gameplay niches aimed to satisfy every small group of players in their fandom. With the release of Overwatch, they took this concept of designing for different players to a global scale by designing for different people. Their aim was not just for diversity in normal terms, but to “hit a level of diversity that's broad enough” that “the conversation totally shifts” [6]. The broad range of representation of their character roster can be seen in the image below. As stated by the game’s director Jeff Kaplan: “So in Overwatch it was less about that obligation that we had to represent everybody and more about creating an approachable, welcoming world, where people feel safe and comfortable.”</p>

    <p class='paragraph'>Similar to Blizzard, Riot Games is a good example of a company that has, in the modern era, made a push towards better representation of diversity in their games. Specifically Riot has pushed back against objectification and body type misrepresentation. Riot Games is a formerly indie company, founded by fans of a similar game known as Dota. The company now owns League of Legends, a free-to-play “multiplayer online battle arena” with over 100 million active monthly players. In 2013, Riot’s game designers made an announcement that they were going to make an active push to be more inclusive in terms of body type within their roster of over 100 characters. They specifically wanted shit the status quo away from the “hourglass girls” that had been made in the past [5] [17]. Since then, they have released, and redesigned, and number of new and old characters, with a focus on fleshing out their identities, as well as including more race and gender diversity.</p>

    <p class='paragraph'>By far the most indie of the trio is Night in the Woods. Night in the Woods is an indie adventure game developed by Infinite Fall studios. The project was crowdfunded by fans of the concept, who raised a total of 200 thousand dollars, over 400% of the original fundraising goal [18]. What makes Night in the Woods unique in terms of representation is how it normalizes subjects not typically considered a part of the “mainstream” in games media. The game initially introduces itself as a mystery adventure, with themes paranormal and eldritch horror, but it later transforms into a story of mental illness, and the struggles of living in a dying town. Additionally, it represents characters with a variety of genders, sexual orientations, and domestic backgrounds with a realistic tone. It’s not over the top in its representation, but it also doesn’t just sprint through these elements as if they were just another character trait. The game does a good job acknowledging how sexuality, mental illness, and domestic abuse can affect a person, without being the definition of their personality (as with many tropes and stereotypes). Much of the positive reception of Night in the Woods is centered on the strength of its characters and the natural feel of the dialogue [7] [8]. Through this representation, Night in the Woods normalizes and humanizes these experiences and characters.</p>

    <p class='paragraph'>Overwatch, League of Legends, and Night in the Woods do an excellent job highlighting how fans of games and genres can have such a large impact on the social issues surrounding gaming as a whole. Not only do fans influence the communities to which they belong and are dedicated to; but fans can also support projects like indie games, bringing greater diversity to games and game culture, and supporting the personal expression of a diverse range of creators. Both of these factors are the driving forces behind the growth of representation in games.</p>
