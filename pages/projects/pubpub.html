		<p class='paragraph'>During the summers of 2015 & 2016, I contributed to the development of Viral Communication’s project, “PubPub.” PubPub is an open source academic publishing platform. The contributions developed included a frontend file uploading interface, a text editor, a backend analytics route, and a front end visualization. The original iteration of the project was built using AngularJS, but prior to the open source release, PubPub was converted to a React, Redux, and Immutable setup.</p>
